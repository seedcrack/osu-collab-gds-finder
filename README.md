# osu-collab-gds-finder
Hi this script is used to find unassigned gds in osu!

as of currently the script is at the VERY VERY basic form
I still have more stuff to do
right now the script can compare the seacrh amount with the gds a mapper has, which is the method I've used
normally it takes like 5-20 mins manually, but now it can be done with a single enter

and again, thanks to ossapi
